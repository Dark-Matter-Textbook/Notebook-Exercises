This repository contains the JUPYTER notebooks that accompany the textbook [Dark Matter](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691249520/dark-matter) by David J. E. Marsh, David Ellis, and Viraf M. Mehta. These notebooks can be used to reproduce certain figures and numerical exercises from the textbook. 

## Contents
These notebooks will be continually updated. An outline of the current content is as follows:

- **Rotation Curves** - (Chapter 3). Plot a simple galaxy rotation curve, and fit different dark matter profiles to data.
- **Gravitational Lensing** - (Chapter 4). A simplified exercise to compute the ellipticity of regions in a sample image, and lens this image.
- **WIMP Relic Density** - (Chapter 9). Numerically solve the Boltzmann equation and hence produce figures for *Y(T)*.
- **Axion Relic Density** - (Chapter 10). Numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation and hence produce figures for *Î¦(t)*.
- **WIMP Direct Detection** - (Chapter 10). Compute recoils rates and exclusion limits.
- **Axion Direct Detection** - (Chapters 14 and 15). Estimate exclusions from haloscopes, helioscopes, and horizontal branch stars.
- **PBH Microlensing** - (Chapter 16). Compute the rate and number of microlensing events, and thus a simple exclusion.

## Notes for Lecturers

If you are using these exercises as part of a course you are teaching, please feel free to clone this repository or download it as a zip file. The solutions can then be hidden in your local version.
